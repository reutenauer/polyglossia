    \makeatletter.  (Not necessary from a technical point of vue, because of one of the changes by Enrico reported below, but I like it better that way :-)

    \ExplSyntaxOn.

  * Corrections to the gloss-dutch.ldf thanks to Wouter Bolsterlee.

    From the git log:
    - Deleted setup for right-to-left writing direction, see http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2011-April/020319.html
    - Changed three appearances of \newcommand to \newrobustcmd, as the commands needs to be protected. Bug reported by "kamensky".
    - Corrected \datepolish as suggested by Piotr Kempa
    - Changed \lccode" into \lccode\string", because it might come into action at wrong times when " is active
    - Changed definition of key xpg@setup, as \@tmpfirst and \@tmpsecond were not expanded, causing dependence of \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin to the last loaded language.  Raised by Vadim Rodionov on the XeTeX mailing list.
    - Deleted \bgroup and \egroup tokens from the definition of otherlanguage*; they serve no purpose (we are already inside an environment) and conflict with csquotes. Noticed by P. Lehman.
    - Changed the calls of \input to \xpg@input, which inputs the required file and resets the catcode of @ to the same value as it had before the input. Since each .ldf file starts with \makeatletter, the old behaviour would leave a category 11 @, which is wrong.
    - Added "\csuse{date#2}" to the definition of "otherlanguage*"

    now replaced by the appropriate non-breaking spaces, as in Babel.

    (pending a complete re-implementation in v1.2):

  * New macros for non-Western decimal digits
    (instead of fontmappings)
  * New gloss files for Asturian, Lithuanian and Urdu
  * hijrical.sty is now locale-aware: \hijritoday is
