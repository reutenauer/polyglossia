  * New test \iflanguageidloaded.
  * New list \xpg@bcp@loaded.
  * New environment {lang}{<lang>} (equivalent to {<lang>},  but also available with

  * Improve interoperatability with biblatex (some language variants did not work yet).

Interface and defaults changes:
  * Some boolean options had 'false' value by default, which meant if you passed
    them without value, the logic was reversed. This has been changed, leading to
    change of behavior should you have used one of these options without value (#363).
    Concerned are the following options:
    - babelshorthands in language belarusian, mongolian, ukrainian, and russian
      ('babelshorthands' now equals 'babelshorthand=true', no longer 'babelshorthands=false')
    - localalph in language slovenian ('localalph' now equals 'localalph=true')
    - latesthyphen in language german ('latesthyphen' now equals 'latesthyphen=true')
    - fullyear in package hebrewcal ('fullyear' now equals 'fullyear=true')
  * The command \setlanguagealias* (introduced in v1.46) does no longer define
    dedicated alias environments.
  * The babelnames for latin variants have been corrected to classiclatin, ecclesiasticlatin
    and medievallatin. This is how the hyphenation patterns and babel \extras are named, even
    though the variants can currently be selected in babel only via appended "dot modifier".
  * In accordance with the respective l3kernel change, \str_lower_case:n  has been renamed to
    \str_lowercase:n where used in polyglossia.sty. Thus polyglossia 1.47 requires l3kernel
    2020-01-12 at least.

    xpg-cyrillicnumbers.sty.
  * In Russian, all paragraphs are now indented by default, as common in Russian typography.
    The behavior can be opted out by indentfirst=false.
  * In Czech, splithyphens and lvna are enabled by default. Also, the option does now work
    as well with LuaTeX.
  * Changed option name "fraktur" to "blackletter" in German (the former is still available

    space now instead of a \thinspace (cf. #345).

  * Conclude every gloss file with \makeatother to match the initial
    \makeatletter.  (Not necessary from a technical point of vue, because of one of the changes by Enrico reported below, but I like it better that way :-)

    From the git log:
    - Deleted setup for right-to-left writing direction, see http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2011-April/020319.html
    - Changed three appearances of \newcommand to \newrobustcmd, as the commands needs to be protected. Bug reported by "kamensky".
    - Corrected \datepolish as suggested by Piotr Kempa
    - Changed \lccode" into \lccode\string", because it might come into action at wrong times when " is active
    - Changed definition of key xpg@setup, as \@tmpfirst and \@tmpsecond were not expanded, causing dependence of \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin to the last loaded language.  Raised by Vadim Rodionov on the XeTeX mailing list.
    - Deleted \bgroup and \egroup tokens from the definition of otherlanguage*; they serve no purpose (we are already inside an environment) and conflict with csquotes. Noticed by P. Lehman.
    - Changed the calls of \input to \xpg@input, which inputs the required file and resets the catcode of @ to the same value as it had before the input. Since each .ldf file starts with \makeatletter, the old behaviour would leave a category 11 @, which is wrong.
    - Added "\csuse{date#2}" to the definition of "otherlanguage*"

  * New macros for non-Western decimal digits
    (instead of fontmappings)
  * New gloss files for Asturian, Lithuanian and Urdu
  * hijrical.sty is now locale-aware: \hijritoday is
