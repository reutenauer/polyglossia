  * Update to gloss-italian.ldf by Claudio Beccari, incorporating changes
    by Enrico Gregorio.
  * Conclude every gloss file with \makeatother to match the initial
    \makeatletter.  (Not necessary from a technical point of vue, because of one of the changes by Enrico reported below, but I like it better that way :-)
  * Conclude polyglossia.sty with \ExplSyntaxOff to match the initial
    \ExplSyntaxOn.
  * Added gloss file for Kannada, contributed by Aravinda VK and others.
  * Corrections to the gloss-dutch.ldf thanks to Wouter Bolsterlee.

    From the git log:
    - Deleted setup for right-to-left writing direction, see http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2011-April/020319.html
    - Changed three appearances of \newcommand to \newrobustcmd, as the commands needs to be protected. Bug reported by "kamensky".
    - Corrected \datepolish as suggested by Piotr Kempa
    - Changed \lccode" into \lccode\string", because it might come into action at wrong times when " is active
    - Changed definition of key xpg@setup, as \@tmpfirst and \@tmpsecond were not expanded, causing dependence of \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin to the last loaded language.  Raised by Vadim Rodionov on the XeTeX mailing list.
    - Deleted \bgroup and \egroup tokens from the definition of otherlanguage*; they serve no purpose (we are already inside an environment) and conflict with csquotes. Noticed by P. Lehman.
    - Changed the calls of \input to \xpg@input, which inputs the required file and resets the catcode of @ to the same value as it had before the input. Since each .ldf file starts with \makeatletter, the old behaviour would leave a category 11 @, which is wrong.
    - Added "\csuse{date#2}" to the definition of "otherlanguage*"

  * New macros for non-Western decimal digits
    (instead of fontmappings)
